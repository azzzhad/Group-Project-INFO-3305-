- 1.1 Introduction<br>

	Hospital Queue Reservation website is an application that replaces the queuing mechanism manually into an internet-based queue. where people no longer need to queue up from the morning. but just choose the date and location of the hospital. then fill in the data accordingly and validly.

- 1.2 Problem Description
    - 1.2.1 Background of the problem <br>

    	People spend a lot of their time in the queue, especially in the hospital. They tend to wait for a long queue and may not leave the place, because there is a possibility that they will miss their turn. 
    	<br>

    	To overcome this problem, many of them are willing to arrive early just to avoid wasting their time.

    - 1.2.2 Problem Statement<br>
    	- The patients have to wait for a long queue to get their service
    	- There are not many system that allows user to pick from various hospital
    

	- 1.3 Project Objective<br>
		We want people to be able to queue without having to waste their time just to get hospital services that are shorter than their waiting time. We also want to be able to choose a queue from any hospital that is still available
		

- 1.4 Project Scope<br>
    - 1.4.1 Scope<br>
		This web application can be used on national or regional scale 
    
    - 1.4.2 Targeted User<br>
    Citizens that requires quick and easy queue reservation process in hospitals
    
    - 1.4.3 Specific Platform<br>
    We will use Servlet, JSP and JavaBean for this project. We will also use JDBC for storing and organizing the patient’s and hospital's data. Besides, we will be using the Tomcat Server and its technologies to fulfill the development. We will use Model View Controller concept for the execution of this project.
    
- 1.5 Constraints<br>
Due to the quite short time period which we have, we might not be able to completely polish this system to be a fully completed system but instead we will try our very best to put in the required main features inside this application. 
Also, being just students it would be impossible for us to fund the development of this web application by ourselves as we do not have the necessary budget.

- 1.6 Project Stages <br>  
Main Page (1 day)
Database (5 days)
Other functionalities (6 days)

- 1.7 Significance of The Project<br>
Patient
- Ease patients so that they do not have to blindly come and wait for their turn without knowing when they are exactly going to be called in by the doctor.

Doctor
- Reduce workload of having to stay inside their workplace for long hours.

- 1.8 Summary
This web application might not be perfect but we surely hope it will be enough come the end of the development phase. 
It is also one of our objectives to see this application serve its purpose which is to help replace previous systems which may be outdated and give everyone at the hospital a non-stressful time whenever they come to visit.
